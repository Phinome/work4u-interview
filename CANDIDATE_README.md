### 3. Design Decisions & Trade-offs

#### **Major Architectural Decisions**

**1. API Migration: @google/generative-ai → @google/genai**
- **Decision**: Migrated from the older `@google/generative-ai` to the newer `@google/genai` package
- **Trade-offs**: 
  - ✅ More modern API with better TypeScript support
  - ✅ Improved streaming capabilities and error handling
  - ❌ Required complete refactoring of AI integration
  - ❌ Less documentation and community examples available
- **Approach**: Used Context7 documentation to understand new API patterns and implemented comprehensive error handling

**2. Server-Sent Events for Real-time Streaming**
- **Decision**: Implemented SSE instead of WebSockets for streaming AI responses
- **Trade-offs**:
  - ✅ Simpler implementation, works with standard HTTP
  - ✅ Better compatibility with serverless deployments
  - ✅ Automatic reconnection handling in browsers
  - ❌ Unidirectional communication only
  - ❌ Less efficient than WebSockets for high-frequency updates
- **Approach**: Used `ReadableStream` with chunked encoding for real-time response delivery

**3. Offline-First Architecture with Mock Responses**
- **Decision**: Built comprehensive offline support with realistic mock data
- **Trade-offs**:
  - ✅ Application remains functional during network issues
  - ✅ Enables development and testing without API dependencies
  - ✅ Provides consistent user experience
  - ❌ Additional complexity in maintaining mock responses
  - ❌ Risk of mock data diverging from real API responses
- **Approach**: Environment variable controlled switching between real and mock responses

**4. SQLite with Prisma ORM**
- **Decision**: Used SQLite for local development with Prisma as the ORM
- **Trade-offs**:
  - ✅ Zero configuration setup for development
  - ✅ Strong TypeScript integration with Prisma
  - ✅ Easy migration to PostgreSQL for production
  - ❌ Not suitable for concurrent production workloads
  - ❌ Limited advanced query capabilities
- **Approach**: Designed schema to be database-agnostic for easy migration

#### **Challenge Features Implementation**

**1. Real-time Streaming Responses**
- **Implementation**: Server-Sent Events with chunked response processing
- **Challenges**: Handling network interruptions and error recovery
- **Solution**: Built retry mechanism with exponential backoff and graceful degradation

**2. Shareable Links**
- **Implementation**: UUID-based public identifiers separate from database IDs
- **Security**: Public IDs don't expose internal database structure
- **UX**: Clean URLs that are easy to share and remember

**3. Toast Notifications**
- **Implementation**: Radix UI toast system with custom styling
- **Challenge**: Initially faced dependency conflicts with @radix-ui/react-toast
- **Solution**: Resolved through careful dependency management and version alignment

**4. Search Functionality**
- **Implementation**: Client-side filtering with debounced input
- **Trade-off**: Simple but effective for moderate data volumes
- **Future**: Could implement full-text search with database indexing

#### **Error Handling Strategy**

**1. Layered Error Handling**
- **Network Layer**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **API Layer**: Detailed error classification and user-friendly messages
- **UI Layer**: Toast notifications and graceful fallbacks
- **Monitoring**: Connection status indicator and diagnostic tools

**2. Error Classification System**
- Network errors → Retry with backoff
- Authentication errors → No retry, user guidance
- Quota errors → No retry, wait guidance
- Generic errors → Limited retry, fallback to offline mode

#### **What I Would Do Differently with More Time**

**1. Enhanced Testing**
- Unit tests for all utility functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing for streaming responses

**2. Advanced Features**
- Full-text search with database indexing
- Response caching and offline storage
- WebSocket support for bidirectional communication
- Advanced AI prompt engineering for better summaries

**3. Production Optimizations**
- Request rate limiting and quota management
- Response compression and CDN integration
- Database connection pooling
- Monitoring and alerting system

**4. UX Improvements**
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Drag-and-drop file upload for transcripts
- Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility improvements
- Dark mode support

**5. Security Enhancements**
- API key rotation mechanism
- Request signing and validation
- Content sanitization and XSS prevention
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
